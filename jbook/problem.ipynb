    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Objective of the project: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict users' movie preferences and suggest a list of movies that are likely to be watched. In other words, give personalized suggestions on movies to watch for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation systems :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Recommendation system?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A recommendation system suggests a product or service to customers who are likely to consume or purchase it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommendation systems are utilized in e-commerce to predict the preference a user might give to an item.\n",
    "  - Netflix : Which movie to watch.\n",
    "  - Amazon : Which products are similar to the one purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other examples of recommendation systems and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Spotify recommends music and playlist\n",
    "  - Facebook recommends friends\n",
    "  - LinkedIn recommends jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Netflix prize (competition 2009)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Competition for the best collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for films.\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Data: Around 100M ratings from 500K  users on 18K movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Winning team used: A Regularized matrix factorization approach. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Recomendation system\n",
    "\n",
    "Data required for Recommendation system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User ratings data\n",
    "- Variables related to items or users (movies genre, duration of the movie... etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recomendation systems : Collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main idea**: Recommending items to users based on the preference of similar users.\n",
    "   - Based on data, we asumme that: A user who has agreed in past tends to also agree in future.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- We only have ratings of user for items.\n",
    "     - Users are consumers.\n",
    "     - Items are the products or services offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach** : Build an \"utility\" matrix that captures interactions between users and items.\n",
    "   - each row is a user\n",
    "   - each column and item\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Collaborative filtering : Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sparsity of utility matrix:\n",
    "   - Usually users only interact with a few items.\n",
    "      - Netflix users rate only a few songs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Objective?\n",
    " - Given a utility matrix of $N$ users and $M$ items, fill the the missing entries to complete the utility matrix. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Unsupervised Learning approach\n",
    "   - Only uses the user-item utility matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goal : learn latent features related to users and items.\n",
    "   - **Matrix factorization algorithm** on the utility matrix to learn latent features related to typical users and typical items.\n",
    "   - Use reconstructions to fill in missing entries.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " #### Problem formulation - Matrix Factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{Y} = Z W$$\n",
    "$$Y \\approx Z W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Z$ - Transformed data. Users to latent features of items\n",
    "- $W$ - Weights.    Items to latent features of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted loss function (MSE) because of sparcity of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{(i, j) \\in R}  (W_{j}^T  Z_{i} - Y_{i,j})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where $R$ is the only available ratings"
